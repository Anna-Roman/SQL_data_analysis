# Background 
This project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills and to help with finding optimal job.

Data hails from [SQL Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.  

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data engineer and data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data engineer and data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?  

# Tools I Used  
- **SQL:** The backbone of data analysis, allows to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Database management and executing SQL queries.
- **GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing the SQL scripts and analysis.  

# The Analysis  
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:  
### 1. Top Paying Data Engineer and Data Analyst Jobs  
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered Data Engineer positions in a first query and Data Analyst positions in a second one by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.  
```sql

    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Engineer' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
